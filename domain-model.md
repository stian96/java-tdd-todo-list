| **1**       | `addTask(String message)`                         | `void`    | Adds a task to the list and sets the boolean value to 'false' as default, <br/> indicating that the task is not completed.                |
| **2**       | `seeAllTasks()`                                   | `String`  | Returns all the tasks nicely formatted as a string.                                                                                       |
| **3**       | `changeTaskStatus(String message, Boolean status)`| `Boolean` | Provide the task message and a boolean value to change the status of the task.                                                            |
